### How to Construct The Datasets


#### 5G Core Network Settings
According to the following standards, the processors and memory usage of different slice types were planned. One network function occupies 1GB of memory and 1 processing unit. However, the UPF is an exception. Since the UPF bears most of the traffic, the data volume of the edge UPF is larger than that of the core data. The core UPF occupies 2GB of memory and 1 processing unit, while the edge UPF occupies 3GB of memory and 2 processing units. Other network functions are shared and are not added to the total number of resources. 

#### The Bandwith of Network Slices
